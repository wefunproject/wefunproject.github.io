  "resumen-teddy": "We present a new application, Digital Teddy, developed to standardize the administration of the Teddy Bear Cancellation Test (TBCT) on a tablet. A practical tool in clinical and academic settings to assess selective visual attention.",
  "teddy-1": "Selective attention is essential in daily life and plays an important role during childhood, as it facilitates the development of movement or cognition. However, there are not enough standardized tools that are practical in clinical and academic settings.",
  "teddy-2": "We present a new application, <em>Digital Teddy</em>, developed to standardize the administration of the Teddy Bear Cancellation Test (TBCT) on a tablet.",
  "teddy-3": "In the initial study, 45 children with typical development aged 2 to 8 years, as well as 27 children with different neurodevelopmental disorders, completed the test in both digital and paper versions.",
  "teddy-4": "The variables measured in the TBCT are the number and location of omissions, as well as the location of the first three targets found. Digital Teddy also records accuracy in target localization and total completion time.",
  "teddy-5": "Preliminary data showed that the number of omissions was similar in both the original and digital versions of the TBCT. The digital TBCT shows good test–retest validity when targets are presented in random order and a first trial is provided to ensure task comprehension. Future studies will expand the sample across different pathologies, also providing normative data. In addition, Digital Teddy records the data with greater precision (accuracy, time, etc.) and can be configured differently according to age or attention level. The data also revealed very high satisfaction among test administrators.",
  "teddy-6": "The sample size is currently being expanded in both number and medical conditions with a risk of attentional deficits. Digital Teddy could be useful in daily clinical practice, as it requires little time, few human and material resources, and uses affordable household technology, showing similar results to the original test.",
  "teddy-7": "We thank the families, nursery schools, and public and private educational centers that helped us collect the data and provided their facilities for the assessments, as well as the project collaborators (Nuria Martín Pozuelo, Isabel de las Cuevas-Terán, and Laura Piccardi).",

  "resumen-ycpem": "How much do young children with and without disabilities participate? This validation project of the Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure tool in the Spanish population will allow the evaluation of the participation of young children (0–5 years) in different environments and the influence of each on their participation.",
  "ycpem-1": "The YC-PEM (short for Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure) is an assessment tool designed to measure the participation of young children (0–5 years) in different environments and how the environment influences that participation. It was mainly developed for use by health, education, and child development professionals, as well as families. It was developed at McMaster University (Canada).",
  "ycpem-2": "In 2021, we signed a collaboration agreement with them to validate the tool for the Spanish population. At present, we have already submitted the cross-cultural adaptation for publication and are finalizing data collection throughout the Spanish territory so that, if validated, it can be used clinically and scientifically in our population.",
  "ycpem-3": "Over these years, we have been able to verify how much young children participate. A lot, even if we do not believe it! And from an early age, children with neurodevelopmental disorders experience difficulties in participation. This tool will help us identify them and implement solutions as early as possible.",
  "ycpem-4": "We thank the families, nursery schools, and public and private educational centers that helped us and facilitated contact with interested families, disseminating the study for data collection, as well as the project collaborators in its different phases.",

  "satco": "SATCo",
  "resumen-satco": "Sitting postural control is fundamental for functional independence and participation in activities of daily living. Validation of the SATCo scale in the Spanish population will provide a valid and reliable clinical tool to assess trunk postural control in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders aged 0 to 18 years.",
  "satco-1": "SATCo (Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control) is a clinical tool used to assess trunk postural control in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, neurological injuries, or delayed motor development. It determines the lowest level of the trunk at which a person can independently maintain trunk control in an upright and aligned position (neutral vertical position), without external support. This information is very useful to identify in detail the optimal level at which support should be provided, quantifying the evolution of postural control after a therapeutic intervention. This is also very relevant since postural ability strongly influences manual ability.",
  "satco-2": "In this project, which began in 2019, we are working to validate this tool in the Spanish population. We have already assessed the postural control of more than 5,040 infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years with typical and atypical development, obtaining very interesting data that we will publish soon. In addition, in this project we collaborated with Professor Penny B Butler by updating the manual of this scale and preparing the Spanish version, which you can find on the <a id='link-optimi' href='https://optimi.org.uk/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>OPTIMI Targeted Training website</a>.",
  "satco-3": "We thank the families, associations, and private rehabilitation centers that helped us and facilitated contact with interested families by disseminating the study for participant recruitment and providing their facilities for data collection, as well as the project collaborators in its different phases. In addition, we thank Leckey for providing us with the specific SATCo bench to carry out the assessments and the Official College of Physiotherapists, which, by granting a research scholarship to one of the researchers, funded part of the project.",
